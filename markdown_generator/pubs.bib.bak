abstract = "Atmospheric low-visibility events are usually associated with fog formation. Extreme low-visibility events deeply affect the air and ground transportation, airports and motor-road facilities causing accidents and traffic problems every year. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been successfully applied to many fog formation and low-visibility prediction problems. The associated problem can be formulated either as a regression or as a classification task, which has an impact on the type of ML approach to be used and on the quality of the predictions obtained. In this paper we carry out a complete analysis of low-visibility events prediction problems, formulated as both regression and classification problems. We discuss the performance of a large number of ML approaches in each type of problem, and evaluate their performance under a common comparison framework. According to the obtained results, we will provide indications on what the most efficient formulation is to tackle low-visibility predictions and the best performing ML approaches for low-visibility events prediction.",

abstract = "Currently, the use of deep learning for solving ordinal classification problems, where categories follow a natural order, has not received much attention. In this paper, we propose an unimodal regularisation based on the beta distribution applied to the cross-entropy loss. This regularisation encourages the distribution of the labels to be a soft unimodal distribution, more appropriate for ordinal problems. Given that the beta distribution has two parameters that must be adjusted, a method to automatically determine them is proposed. The regularised loss function is used to train a deep neural network model with an ordinal scheme in the output layer. The results obtained are statistically analysed and show that the combination of these methods increases the performance in ordinal problems. Moreover, the proposed beta distribution performs better than other distributions proposed in previous works, achieving also a reduced computational cost.",

abstract = "Nowadays, decision support systems (DSSs) are widely used in several application domains, from industrial to healthcare and medicine fields. Concerning the industrial scenario, we propose a DSS oriented to the aesthetic quality control (AQC) task, which has quickly established itself as one of the most crucial challenges of Industry 4.0. Taking into account the increasing amount of data in this domain, the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques offers great opportunities to automatize the overall AQC process. State-of-the-art is mainly oriented to approach this problem with a nominal DL classification method which does not exploit the ordinal structure of the AQC task, thus not penalizing the error among distant AQC classes (which is a relevant aspect for the real use case). The paper introduces a DL ordinal methodology for the AQC classification. Differently from other deep ordinal methods, we combined the standard categorical cross-entropy with the cumulative link model and we imposed the ordinal constraint via the thresholds and slope parameters. Experimental results were performed for solving an AQC task on a novel image dataset originated from a specific companys demand (i.e., aesthetic assessment of wooden stocks). We demonstrated how the proposed methodology is able to reduce misclassification errors (up to 0.937 quadratic weight kappa loss) among distant classes while overcoming other state-of-the-art deep ordinal models and reducing the bias factor related to the item geometry. The proposed DL approach was integrated as the main core of a DSS supported by Internet of Things (IoT) architecture that can support the human operator by reducing up to 90\% the time needed for the qualitative analysis carried out manually in this specific domain.",

abstract = "The prediction of wave height and flux of energy is essential for most ocean engineering applications. To simultaneously predict both wave parameters, this paper presents a novel approach using short-term time prediction horizons (6h and 12h). Specifically, the methodology proposed presents a twofold simultaneity: 1) both parameters are predicted by a single model, applying the multi-task learning paradigm, and 2) the prediction tasks are tackled for several neighbouring ocean buoys with such single model by the development of a zonal strategy. Multi-Task Evolutionary Artificial Neural Network (MTEANN) models are applied to two different zones located in the United States, considering measurements collected by three buoys in each zone. Zonal MTEANN models have been compared in a two-phased procedure: 1) against the three individual MTEANN models specifically trained for each buoy of the zone, and 2) against some state-of-the-art regression techniques. Results achieved show that the proposed zonal methodology obtains not only better performance than the individual MTEANN models, but it also requires a lower number of connections. Besides, the zonal MTEANN methodology outperforms state-of-the-art regression techniques. Hence, the proposed approach results in an excellent method for predicting both significant wave height and flux of energy at short-term prediction time

This diagnosis process can be automatized to help medical staff through Decision Support Systems (DSSs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are good candidates, because they are effective when applied to spatial data. This paper proposes a 3D CNN ordinal model for assessing the level or neurological damage in PD patients. Given that CNN need large datasets to achieve acceptable performance, a data augmentation method is adapted to work with spatial data. We consider the Ordinal Graph-based Oversampling via Shortest Paths (OGO-SP) OGO-SP method, which applies a gamma probability distribution for inter-class data generation. A modification of OGO-SP is proposed, the OGO-SP-B algorithm, which applies the beta distribution for generating synthetic samples in the inter-class region, a better suited distribution when compared to gamma. The evaluation of the different methods is based on a novel 3D image dataset provided by the Hospital Universitario Reina Sof{\'i}a (C{\'o}rdoba, Spain). We show how the ordinal methodology improves the performance with respect to the nominal one, and how OGO-SP-B yields better performance than OGO-SP.",

abstract = "Parkinsons disease is characterised by a decrease in the density of presynaptic dopamine transporters in the striatum. Frequently, the corresponding diagnosis is performed using a qualitative analysis of the 3D-images obtained after the administration of 123I-ioflupane, considering a binary classification problem (absence or existence of Parkinsons disease). In this work, we propose a new methodology for classifying this kind of images in three classes depending on the level of severity of the disease in the image. To tackle this problem, we use an ordinal classifier given the natural order of the class labels. A novel strategy to perform feature selection is developed because of the large number of voxels in the image, and a method for generating synthetic images is proposed to improve the quality of the classifier. The methodology is tested on 434 studies conducted between September 2015 and January 2019, divided into three groups: 271 without alteration of the presynaptic nigrostriatal pathway, 73 with a slight alteration and 90 with severe alteration. Results confirm that the methodology improves the state-of-the-art algorithms, and that it is able to find informative voxels outside the standard regions of interest used for this problem. The differences are assessed by statistical tests which show that the proposed image ordinal classification could be considered as a decision support system in medicine.",

abstract = "An efficient management of solar power systems requires direct and continuous predictions of global irradiation received on inclined planes. This paper proposes a new approach that simultaneously estimates and forecasts inclined solar irradiation. The method is based on a multi-task Hybrid Evolutionary Neural Network with two output neurons: one estimates the irradiation at the current instant and another predicts it for the next hour. An Evolutionary Algorithm is used to learn the most proper topology (number of neurons and connections). Two studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the method, considering experimental ground data for the same inclination angle and satellite data with different tilt angles. The data only contain one measured variable, what improves its applicability to other sites. The potential of three different basis functions in the hidden layer is compared (Sigmoidal Units, Radial Basis Functions and Product Units), concluding that the results achieved by Sigmoidal Units are better. Single and multi-task models are also compared with a statistical analysis, which shows no significant differences. However, the proposed multi-task option is much simpler and computationally efficient than individual models. The problem tackled is more complex and challenging than previous works, due to inclined solar irradiation is predicted based on the horizontal irradiation and also because the model simultaneously estimates and predicts irradiation. However, the performance obtained is excellent compared to the literature.",

Modelling techniques were divided into two groups: 1) classical statistical methods, including Logistic Regression (LR) and Na{\"i}ve Bayes (NB), and 2) standard machine learning techniques, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB) or Support Vector Machines (SVM), among others.

Moreover, LR also outperformed standard scores. The same pattern was reproduced for the others 3 end-points.

abstract = "Wind power ramp events (WPREs) are strong increases or decreases of wind speed in a short period of time. Predicting WPREs in wind farms is of vital importance given that they can produce damages in the turbines, and, in any case, they suddenly affect the wind farm production. In contrast to previous binary definitions of the prediction problem (ramp versus non-ramp), a three-class prediction model is used in this paper, proposing a novel discretization function, able to detect the nature of WPREs: negative ramp, non-ramp and positive ramp events. Moreover, the natural order of these labels is exploited to obtain better results in the prediction of these events. The independent variables used for prediction include, in this case, past wind speed values and meteorological data obtained from physical models (reanalysis data). Reanalysis will be also used for recovering missing data from the measuring stations in the wind farm. The proposed prediction methodology is based on Reservoir Computing and an over-sampling process for alleviating the high degree of unbalance in the dataset (non-ramp events are much more frequent than ramps). Three elements are combined in the prediction method: a recurrent neural network layer, a nonlinear kernel mapping and an ordinal logistic regression,to exploit the information provided by the order of the classes). Preprocessing is based on a variation of the standard synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), which is applied to the reservoir activations (since the direct application over the input variables would damage its temporal structure). The performance of the method is analysed by comparing it against other state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines, nominal logistic regression, an autoregressive ordinal neural network, or the use of leaky integrator neurons instead of the standard sigmoidal units. From the results obtained, the benefits of the kernel mapping and the ordinal model are clear, and, in general, the performance obtained with the Reservoir Computing approach is shown to be very robust in the detection of ramps.",

The prediction problem has been tackled exclusively from satellite-based measurements and variables, which avoids the use of data from ground stations or atmospheric soundings. Specifically, three types of neural computation approaches are considered: neural networks with sigmoid-based neurons, radial basis function units and product units. In all cases these neural computation algorithms are trained by means of evolutionary algorithms, leading to robust and accurate models for solar radiation prediction. The results obtained in the solar radiation estimation at the radiometric station of Toledo show an excellent performance of evolutionary neural networks tested. The structure sigmoid unit-product unit with evolutionary training has been shown as the best model among all tested in this paper, able to obtain an extremely accurate prediction of the solar radiation from satellite images data, and outperforming all other evolutionary neural networks tested, and alternative Machine Learning approaches such as Support Vector Regressors or Extreme Learning Machines.",

Analysing the main tasks for which they are being applied, together with the advantages and disadvantages of their use, can be of crucial interest for clinical practitioners. Recent findings: In the last 10 years, there has been an explosion of interest in the application of ML techniques to organ transplantation. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature aiming to find universal models by considering multicenter cohorts or from different countries. Moreover, recently, deep learning has also been applied demonstrating a notable ability when dealing with a vast amount of information. Summary: Organ transplantation can benefit from ML in such a way to improve the current procedures for donor-recipient matching or to improve standard scores. However, a correct preprocessing is needed to provide consistent and high quality databases for ML algorithms, aiming to robust and fair approaches to support expert decision-making systems.",

The link functions are those used for cumulative link models, which are traditional statistical linear models based on projecting each pattern into a 1-dimensional space. A set of ordered thresholds splits this space into the different classes of the problem. In our case, the projections are estimated by a non-linear deep neural network. To further improve the results, we combine these ordinal models with a loss function that takes into account the distance between the categories, based on the weighted Kappa index. Three different link functions are studied in the experimental study, and the results are contrasted with statistical analysis. The experiments run over two different ordinal classification problems and the statistical tests confirm that these models improve the results of a nominal model and outperform other robust proposals considered in the literature.",

abstract = "Convolutional Neural Networks stands at the front of many solutions which deal with computer vision related tasks. The use and the applications of these models are growing unceasingly, as well as the complexity required to deal with bigger and highly complex problems. However, hitting the most suitable model for solving a specific task is not trivial. A very manually intensive and time consuming trial-and-error experimentation is needed in order to find an architecture, hyperparameters and parameters which reach a certain level of performance. Moreover, this process leads to oversized models, diminishing their generalisation capacity. In this paper, we leverage a metaheuristic and a hybridisation process to optimise the reasoning block of CNN models, composed by fully connected and dropout layers, conducting a full reconstruction that leads to lighter models with better performance. Our approach is architecture-independent and operates at the topology, hyperparameters and parameters (connection weights) levels. For that purpose, we have implemented the Hybrid Statistically-driven Coral Reef Optimisation (HSCRO) algorithm as an extension of SCRO, a metaheuristic which does not require to adjust any parameter since they are automatically and dynamically chosen based on the statistical characteristics of the evolution. In addition, a hybridisation process employs the backpropagation algorithm to make a final fine-grained weights adjustment. In the experiments, the VGG-16 model is successfully optimised in two different scenarios (the CIFAR-10 and the CINIC-10 datasets), resulting in a lighter architecture, with an 88% reduction of the connection weights, but without losing its generalisation performance.",

abstract = "In this paper we tackle a problem of convective situations analysis at Adolfo-Suarez Madrid-Barajas International Airport (Spain), based on Ordinal Regression algorithms. The diagnosis of convective clouds is key in a large airport like Barajas, since these meteorological events are associated with strong winds and local precipitation, which may affect air and land operations at the airport. In this work, we deal with a 12-h time horizon in the analysis of convective clouds, using as input variables data from a radiosonde station and also from numerical weather models. The information about the objective variable (convective clouds presence at the airport) has been obtained from the Madrid-Barajas METAR and SPECI aeronautical reports. We treat the problem as an ordinal regression task, where there exist a natural order among the classes. Moreover, the classification problem is highly imbalanced, since there are very few convective clouds events compared to clear days. Thus, a process of oversampling is applied to the database in order to obtain a better balance of the samples for this specific problem. An important number of ordinal regression methods are then tested in the experimental part of the work, showing that the best approach for this problem is the SVORIM algorithm, based on the Support Vector Machine strategy, but adapted for ordinal regression problems. The SVORIM algorithm shows a good accuracy in the case of thunderstorms and Cumulonimbus clouds, which represent a real hazard for the airport operations.",

abstract = "In Machine Learning, the most common way to address a given problem is to optimize an error measure by training a single model to solve the desired task. However, sometimes it is possible to exploit latent information from other related tasks to improve the performance of the main one, resulting in a learning paradigm known as Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In this context, the high computational capacity of deep neural networks (DNN) can be combined with the improved generalization performance of MTL, by designing independent output layers for every task and including a shared representation for them. In this paper we exploit this theoretical framework on a problem related to Wind Power Ramps Events (WPREs) prediction in wind farms. Wind energy is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, with potential global spreading and deep penetration in developed and developing countries. One of the main issues with the majority of renewable energy resources is their intrinsic intermittency, which makes it difficult to increase the penetration of these technologies into the energetic mix. In this case, we focus on the specific problem of WPREs prediction, which deeply affect the wind speed and power prediction, and they are also related to different turbines damages. Specifically, we exploit the fact that WPREs are spatially-related events, in such a way that predicting the occurrence of WPREs in different wind farms can be taken as related tasks, even when the wind farms are far away from each other. We propose a DNN-MTL architecture, receiving inputs from all the wind farms at the same time to predict WPREs simultaneously in each of the farms locations. The architecture includes some shared layers to learn a common representation for the information from all the wind farms, and it also includes some specification layers, which refine the representation to match the specific characteristics of each location. Finally we modified the Adam optimization algorithm for dealing with imbalanced data, adding costs which are updated dynamically depending on the worst classified class. We compare the proposal against a baseline approach based on building three different independent models (one for each wind farm considered), and against a state-of-the-art reservoir computing approach. The DNN-MTL proposal achieves very good performance in WPREs prediction, obtaining a good balance for all the classes included in the problem (negative ramp, no ramp and positive ramp).",

The methodology proposed is based on the Multi-Task Learning paradigm in order to solve the four problems with a single model. We consider Multi-Task Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (MTEANN) with four outputs, one for each time prediction horizon. For this purpose, three buoys located at the Gulf of Alaska are considered. Measurements collected by these buoys are used to obtain the target values of energy flux, whereas, only reanalysis data are used as input values, allowing the applicability to other locations. The performance of three different basis functions (Sigmoidal Unit, Radial Basis Function and Product Unit) are compared against some popular stateof-the-art approaches such as Extreme Learning Machines and Support Vector Regressors. The results show that MTEANN methodology using Sigmoidal Units in the hidden layer and a linear output achieves the best performance. In this way, the multi-task methodology is an excellent and lower-complexity approach for energy flux prediction at both short- and long-term prediction time horizons. Furthermore, the results also confirm that reanalysis data is enough for describing well the problem tackled.",

abstract = "Currently, knowledge discovery in databases is an essential first step when identifying valid, novel and useful patterns for decision making. There are many real-world scenarios, such as bankruptcy prediction, option pricing or medical diagnosis, where the classification models to be learned need to fulfill restrictions of monotonicity (i.e. the target class label should not decrease when input attributes values increase). For instance, it is rational to assume that a higher debt ratio of a company should never result in a lower level of bankruptcy risk. Consequently, there is a growing interest from the data mining research community concerning monotonic predictive models. This paper aims to present an overview of the literature in the field, analyzing existing techniques and proposing a taxonomy of the algorithms based on the type of model generated. For each method, we review the quality metrics considered in the evaluation and the different data sets and monotonic problems used in the analysis. In this way, this paper serves as an overview of monotonic classification research in specialized literature and can be used as a functional guide for the field.",

abstract = "Recent studies propose that different dynamical systems, such as climate, ecological and financial systems, among others, present critical transition points named to as tipping points (TPs). Climate TPs can severely affect millions of lives on Earth so that an active scientific community is working on finding early warning signals. This paper deals with the development of a time series segmentation algorithm for paleoclimate data in order to find segments sharing common statistical patterns. The proposed algorithm uses a clustering-based approach for evaluating the solutions and six statistical features, most of which have been previously considered in the detection of early warning signals in paleoclimate TPs. Due to the limitations of classical statistical methods, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm to automatically segment the series, together with a method to compare the segmentations. The final segments provided by the algorithm are used to construct a prediction model, whose promising results show the importance of segmentation for improving the understanding of a time series.",

abstract = "Time series segmentation is aimed at representing a time series by using a set of segments. Some researchers perform segmentation by approximating each segment with a simple model (e.g. a linear interpolation), while others focus their efforts on obtaining homogeneous groups of segments, so that common patterns or behaviours can be detected. The main hypothesis of this paper is that both objectives are conflicting, so time series segmentation is proposed to be tackled from a multiobjective perspective, where both objectives are simultaneously considered, and the expert can choose the desired solution from a Pareto Front of different segmentations. A specific multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is designed for the purpose of deciding the cut points of the segments, integrating a clustering algorithm for fitness evaluation. The experimental validation of the methodology includes three synthetic time series and three time series from real-world problems. Nine clustering quality assessment metrics are experimentally compared to decide the most suitable one for the algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows good performance for both clustering quality and reconstruction error, improving the results of other mono-objective alternatives of the state-of-the-art and showing better results than a simple weighted linear combination of both corresponding fitness functions.",

abstract = "Melanoma is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Usually occurring on the skin, early detection and diagnosis is strongly related to survival rates. Melanoma recognition is a challenging task that nowadays is performed by well trained dermatologists who may produce varying diagnosis due to the task complexity. This motivates the development of automated diagnosis tools, in spite of the inherent difficulties (intra-class variation, visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, among others). In the present work, we propose a system combining image analysis and machine learning to detect melanoma presence and severity. The severity is assessed in terms of melanoma thickness, which is measured by the Breslow index. Previous works mainly focus on the binary problem of detecting the presence of the melanoma. However, the system proposed in this paper goes a step further by also considering the stage of the lesion in the classification task. To do so, we extract 100 features that consider the shape, colour, pigment network and texture of the benign and malignant lesions. The problem is tackled as a five-class classification problem, where the first class represents benign lesions, and the remaining four classes represent the different stages of the melanoma (via the Breslow index). Based on the problem definition, we identify the learning setting as a partial order problem, in which the patterns belonging to the different melanoma stages present an order relationship, but where there is no order arrangement with respect to the benign lesions. Under this assumption about the class topology, we design several proposals to exploit this structure and improve data preprocessing. In this sense, we experimentally demonstrate that those proposals exploiting the partial order assumption achieve better performance than 12 baseline nominal and ordinal classifiers (including a deep learning model) which do not consider this partial order. To deal with class imbalance, we additionally propose specific over-sampling techniques that consider the structure of the problem for the creation of synthetic patterns. The experimental study is carried out with clinician-curated images from the Interactive Atlas of Dermoscopy, which eases reproducibility of experiments. Concerning the results obtained, in spite of having augmented the complexity of the classification problem with more classes, the performance of our proposals in the binary problem is similar to the one reported in the literature.",

abstract = "Time Series Forecasting (TSF) consists on estimating models to predict future values based on previously observed values of time series, and it can be applied to solve many real-world problems. TSF has been traditionally tackled by considering AutoRegressive Neural Networks (ARNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), where hidden nodes are usually configured using additive activation functions, such as sigmoidal functions. ARNNs are based on a short-term memory of the time series in the form of lagged time series values used as inputs, while RNNs include a long-term memory structure. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it explores the potential of multiplicative nodes for ARNNs, by considering Product Unit (PU) activation functions, motivated by the fact that PUs are specially useful for modelling highly correlated features, such as the lagged time series values used as inputs for ARNNs. Second, it proposes a new hybrid RNN model based on PUs, by estimating the PU outputs from the combination of a long-term reservoir and the short-term lagged time series values. A complete set of experiments with 29 datasets shows competitive performance for both model proposals, and a set of statistical tests confirms that they achieve the state-of-the-art in TSF, with specially promising results for the proposed hybrid RNN. The experiments in this paper shows that the recurrent model is very competitive for relatively large time series, where longer forecast horizons are required, while the autorregresive model is a good selection if the dataset is small or if a low computational cost is needed.

A modification of the coral reefs optimization metaheuristic (CRO) is proposed for this purpose, which is called statistical CRO (SCRO), where the main parameters of the algorithm are adjusted based on the mean and standard deviation associated with the fitness distribution. Moreover, the algorithm is combined with the Bottom-Up and Top-Down methodologies (traditional local search methods for time series segmentation), resulting in a hybrid methodology (HSCRO). We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using 16 time series from different application areas. The statistically-driven version of CRO is shown to improve the results of the standard CRO, eliminating the necessity of manually adjusting the main parameters of the algorithm and dynamically adjusting these parameters throughout the evolution. Moreover, when compared with other local search methods and metaheuristics from the state of the art, HSCRO shows robust segmentation results, consistently obtaining lower approximation errors.",

abstract = "The properties of biodiesel differ depending on feedstock fatty acid content. Moreover, biodiesel fatty acid composition influences the combustion process. For these reasons, noise emissions of a direct injection Perkins diesel engine fueled with olive pomace oil methyl ester (monounsaturated methyl esters) and palm oil methyl ester (saturated methyl esters) were studied under several steady-state engine operating conditions. In this work, different approaches for sound prediction of the engine based on Neural Network (NN) models, such as Product Unit NN (PUNN), Radial Basis Function NN (RBFNN) and response surface models have been proposed. Error was measured considering Mean Square Error (MSE) and Standard Error of Prediction (SEP). It can be concluded that the use of a hybrid model combining PU and RBF improves noise prediction accuracy, providing an acceptable value of both MSE and SEP when monounsaturated methyl ester/diesel fuel blends are used. However, best results for saturated methyl ester/diesel fuel blends were achieved by PUNN model. Whereas taking into account the simplicity of the model, PUNN model is the most appropriate for both monounsaturated and saturated methyl ester/diesel fuel blends. Response surface models have shown worse results based on the coefficient of correlation. Also, the effect of independent variables in the models has been studied and an inverse relationship between frequency and engine noise has been found",

abstract = "The prediction of low-visibility events is very important in many human activities, and crucial in transportation facilities such as airports, where they can cause severe impact in flight scheduling and safety. The design of accurate predictors for low-visibility events can be approached by modelling future visibility conditions based on past values of different input variables, recorded at the airport. The use of autoregressive time series forecasters involves adjusting the order of the model (number of past series values or size of the sliding window), which usually depends on the dynamical nature of the time series. Moreover, the same window size is normally used for all the data, thought it would be reasonable to use different sliding windows. In this paper, we propose a hybrid prediction model for daily low-visibility events, which combines fixed-size and dynamic windows, and adapts its size according to the dynamics of the time series. Moreover, visibility is labelled using three ordered categories (FOG, MIST and CLEAR), and the prediction is then carried out by means of ordinal classifiers, in order to take advantage of the ordinal nature of low-visibility events. We evaluate the model using a dataset from Valladolid airport (Spain), where radiation fog is very common in autumn and winter months. The considered data set includes five different meteorological input variables (wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity and QNH - pressure adjusted at mean sea level) and the Runway Visual Range (RVR), which is used to characterize the low-visibility events at the airport. The results show that the proposed hybrid window model with ordinal classification leads to very robust performance prediction in daily time-horizon, improving the results obtained by the persistence model and alternative prediction schemes tested.",

This hybrid genetic algorithm includes a local search method aimed to improve the quality of the final solution. The local search algorithm is based on maximizing a likelihood ratio, assuming normality for the series and the subseries in which the original one is segmented. To do so, we select two stock market index time series: IBEX35 Spanish index (closing prices) and a weighted average (AVG) time series of the IBEX35 (Spanish), BEL20 (Belgian), CAC40 (French) and DAX (German) indexes. These are processed to obtain segments that are mapped into a five dimensional space composed of five statistical measures, with the purpose of grouping them according to their statistical properties.

The methodology firstly characterizes the wave height time series by approximating it using a sequence of labeled segments, and then a binary classifier is trained to predict the occurrence of SSWH periods based on past height values. A genetic algorithm (GA) combined with a likelihood-based local search is proposed for the first stage (detection), and the second stage (prediction) is tackled by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained with a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA). Given the unbalanced nature of the dataset (SSWH are rarer than non SSWH), the MOEA is specifically designed to obtain a balance between global accuracy and individual sensitivities for both classes. The results obtained show that the GA is able to group SSWH in a specific cluster of segments and that the MOEA obtains ANN models able to perform an acceptable prediction of these SSWH.",

abstract = "Liver transplantation is a promising and widely-accepted treatment for patients with terminal liver disease. However, transplantation is restricted by the lack of suitable donors, resulting in significant waiting list deaths. This paper proposes a novel donor-recipient allocation system that uses machine learning to predict graft survival after transplantation using a dataset comprised of donor-recipient pairs from the King's College Hospital (United Kingdom). The main novelty of the system is that it tackles the imbalanced nature of the dataset by considering semi-supervised learning, analysing its potential for obtaining more robust and equitable models in liver transplantation. We propose two different sources of unsupervised data for this specific problem (recent transplants and virtual donor-recipient pairs) and two methods for using these data during model construction (a semi-supervised algorithm and a label propagation scheme). The virtual pairs and the label propagation method are shown to alleviate the imbalanced distribution. The results of our experiments show that the use of synthetic and real unsupervised information helps to improve and stabilise the performance of the model and leads to fairer decisions with respect to the use of only supervised data. Moreover, the best model is combined with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (MELD), which is at the moment the most popular assignation methodology worldwide. By doing this, our decision-support system considers both the compatibility of the donor and the recipient (by our prediction system) and the recipient severity (via the MELD score), supporting then the principles of fairness and benefit.

abstract = "This paper presents four configurations of a genetic algorithm (GA) combined with a local search (LS) method for time series segmentation with the purpose of correctly recognising extreme values. The LS method is based on likelihood maximisation of a beta distribution. The proposal is tested on three real ocean wave height time series, where extreme values are frequently found. Concretely, the time series are taken from two oceanographic buoys in the Gulf of Alaska, and another one from Puerto Rico. The results show that the different combinations of LS improve the results of the GA. Furthermore, the algorithm provides segmentations where extreme values are grouped in a well defined cluster, which allows the study of the characteristics of this type of events.",

abstract = "Objective:
Create an efficient decision-support model to assist medical experts in the process of organ allocation in liver transplantation. The mathematical model proposed here uses different sources of information to predict the probability of organ survival at different thresholds for each donor-recipient pair considered. Currently, this decision is mainly based on the Model for End-stage Liver Disease, which depends only on the severity of the recipient and obviates donor-recipient compatibility. We therefore propose to use information concerning the donor, the recipient and the surgery, with the objective of allocating the organ correctly.
Methods and materials: 
The database consists of information concerning transplants conducted in 7 different Spanish hospitals and the King's College hospital (United Kingdom). The state of the patients is followed up for 12 months. We propose to treat the problem as an ordinal classification one, where we predict the organ survival at different thresholds: less than 15 days, between 15 and 90 days, between 90 and 365 days and more than 365 days. This discretization is intended to produce finer-grain survival information (compared with the common binary approach). However, it results in a highly imbalanced dataset in which more than 85% of cases belong to the last class. To solve this, we combine two approaches, a cost-sensitive evolutionary ordinal artificial neural network (ANN) (in which we propose to incorporate dynamic weights to make more emphasis on the worst classified classes) and an ordinal over-sampling technique (which adds virtual patterns to the minority classes and thus alleviates the imbalanced nature of the dataset).
Results:
The results obtained by our proposal are promising and satisfactory, considering the overall accuracy, the ordering of the classes and the sensitivity of minority classes. In this sense, both the dynamic costs and the over-sampling technique improve the base results of the considered ANN-based method. Comparing our model with other state-of-the-art techniques in ordinal classification, competitive results can also be appreciated. The results achieved with this proposal improve the ones obtained by other
state-of-the-art models: we were able to correctly predict more than 70% of the transplantation results, with a geometric mean of
the sensitivities of 33.34%, which is much higher than the one obtained by other models. 
Conclusions:
The combination of the proposed cost-sensitive evolutionary algorithm together with the application of an over-sampling technique improves the predictive capability of our model in a significant way (especially for minority classes), which can help the surgeons make more informed decisions about the most appropriate recipient for an specific donor organ, in order to
maximize the probability of survival after the transplantation and therefore the fairness principle.",

abstract = "Ordinal classification considers those classification problems where the labels of the variable to predict follow a given order. Naturally, labelled data is scarce or difficult to obtain in this type of problems because, in many cases, ordinal labels are given by an user or expert (e.g. in recommendation systems). Firstly, this paper develops a new strategy for ordinal classification where both labelled and unlabelled data are used in the model construction step (a scheme which is referred to as semi-supervised learning). More specifically, the ordinal version of kernel discriminant learning is extended for this setting considering the neighbourhood information of unlabelled data, which is proposed to be computed in the feature space induced by the kernel function. Secondly, a new method for semi-supervised kernel learning is devised in the context of ordinal classification, which is combined with our developed classification strategy to optimise the kernel parameters. The experiments conducted compare 6 different approaches for semi-supervised learning in the context of ordinal classification in a battery of 30 datasets, showing (1) the good synergy of the ordinal version of discriminant analysis and the use of unlabelled data and (2) the advantage of computing distances in the feature space induced by the kernel function.",

abstract = "The imbalanced nature of some real-world data is one of the current challenges for machine learning researchers. One common approach over-samples the minority class through convex combination of its patterns. We explore the general idea of synthetic over-sampling in the feature space induced by a kernel function (as opposed to input space). If the kernel function matches the underlying problem, the classes will be linearly separable and synthetically generated patterns will lie on the minority class region. Since the feature space is not directly accessible, we use the empirical feature space (a Euclidean space isomorphic to the feature space) for over-sampling purposes. The proposed method is framed in the context of support vector machines where imbalanced datasets can pose a serious hindrance. The idea is investigated in three scenarios: 1) over-sampling in the full and reduced-rank empirical feature spaces; 2) a kernel learning technique maximising the data class separation to study the influence of the feature space structure (implicitly defined by the kernel function); 3) a unified framework for preferential over-sampling that spans some of the previous approaches in the literature. We support our investigation with extensive experiments over $50$ imbalanced datasets.",

Ordinal classification has been widely studied in specialized literature, but monotonic classification has received relatively low attention. In this paper, we define and relate both tasks in a common framework, providing proper descriptions, characteristics, and a categorization of existing approaches in the state-of-the-art.

Although ordinal regression can be faced using standard nominal classification techniques, there are several algorithms which can specifically benefit from the ordering information. Therefore, this paper is aimed at reviewing the state of the art on these techniques and proposing a taxonomy based on how the models are constructed to take the order into account. Furthermore, a thorough experimental study is proposed to check if the use of the order information improves the performance of the models obtained, considering some of the approaches within the taxonomy. The results confirm that ordering information benefits ordinal models improving their accuracy and the closeness of the predictions to actual targets in the ordinal scale.

abstract = "Thickness of the melanoma is the most important factor associated with survival in patients with melanoma. It is most commonly reported as a measurement of depth given in millimeters (mm) and computed by means of pathological examination after a biopsy of the suspected lesion. In order to avoid the use of an invasive method in the estimation of the thickness of melanoma before surgery, we propose a computational image analysis system from dermoscopic images. The proposed feature extraction is based on the clinical findings that correlate certain characteristics present in dermoscopic images and tumor depth. Two supervised classification schemes are proposed: a binary classification in which melanomas are classified into thin or thick, and a three-class scheme (thin, intermediate, and thick). The performance of several nominal classification methods, including a recent interpretable method combining logistic regression with artificial neural networks (Logistic regression using Initial variables and Product Units, LIPU), is compared. For the threeclass problem, a set of ordinal classification methods (considering ordering relation between the three classes) is included. For the binary case, LIPU outperforms all the other methods with an accuracy of 77.6%, while, for the second scheme, although LIPU reports the highest overall accuracy, the ordinal classification methods achieve a better balance between the performances of all classes.",

abstract = "Kernel mapping is one of the most widespread approaches to in- trinsically deriving nonlinear classifiers. With the aim of better suiting a given dataset, different kernels have been proposed and different bounds and methodologies have been studied to optimise them. We focus on the opti- misation of a multi-scale kernel, where a different width is chosen for each feature. This idea has been barely studied in the literature, although it has been shown to achieve better performance in the presence of heterogeneous attributes. The large number of parameters in multi-scale kernels makes it computationally unaffordable to optimise them by applying traditional cross- validation. Instead, an analytical measure known as centered kernel-target alignment (CKTA) can be used to align the kernel to the so-called ideal kernel matrix. This paper analyses and compares this and other alternatives, provid- ing a review of the literature in kernel optimisation and some insights into the usefulness of multi-scale kernel optimisation via CKTA. When applied to the binary support vector machine paradigm (SVM), the results using 24 datasets show that CKTA with a multi-scale kernel leads to the construction of a well- defined feature space and simpler SVM models, provides an implicit filtering of non-informative features and achieves robust and comparable performance to other methods even when using random initialisations. Finally, we derive some considerations about when a multi-scale approach could be, in general, useful and propose a distance-based initialisation technique for the gradient-ascent method, which shows promising results.

abstract = "The classification of patterns into naturally ordered labels is referred to as ordinal regression or ordinal classification. Usually, this classification setting is by nature highly imbalanced, because there are classes in the problem that are a priori more probable than others. Although standard over-sampling methods can improve the classification of minority classes in ordinal classification, they tend to introduce severe errors in terms of the ordinal label scale, given that they do not take the ordering into account. A specific ordinal over- sampling method is developed in this paper for the first time in order to improve the performance of machine learning classifiers. The method proposed includes ordinal information by approaching over-sampling from a graph-based perspective. The results presented in this paper show the good synergy of a popular ordinal regression method (a reformulation of support vector machines) with the graph- based proposed algorithms, and the possibility of improving both the classification and the ordering of minority classes. A cost-sensitive version of the ordinal regression method is also introduced and compared with the over-sampling proposals, showing in general lower performance for minority classes. ",

The segments are transformed into a six-dimensional space composed of six statistical measures, most of which have been previously considered in the detection of warning signals of critical transitions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach applied to paleoclimate data could effectively analyse Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events and uncover commonalities and differences in their statistical and possibly their dynamical characterisation. In particular, warning signals were robustly detected in the GISP2 and NGRIP delta18O ice core data for several DO events (e.g. DO 1, 4, 8 and 12) in the form of an order of magnitude increase in variance, autocorrelation and mean square distance from a linear approximation (i.e. the mean square error). The increase in mean square error, suggesting nonlinear behaviour, has been found to correspond with an increase in variance prior to several DO events for - 90 % of the algorithm runs for the GISP2 delta18O dataset and for aprox 100 % of the algorithm runs for the NGRIP delta18O dataset. The proposed approach applied to well-known dynamical systems and paleoclimate datasets provides a novel visualisation tool in the field of climate time series analysis.",

The study is motivated by SVM+, which models the slacks through a smooth correcting function that is determined by additional (privileged) information about the training examples not available in the test phase. We take a closer look at the meaning and consequences of smooth modeling of slacks, as opposed to determining them in an unconstrained manner through the SVM optimization program. To better understand this difference we only allow the determination and modeling of slack values on the same information-that is, using the same training input in the original input space. We also explore whether it is possible to improve classification performance by combining (in a convex combination) the original SVM slacks with the modeled ones. We show experimentally that this approach not only leads to improved generalization performance but also yields more compact, lower-complexity models. Finally, we extend this idea to the context of ordinal regression, where a natural order among the classes exists. The experimental results confirm principal findings from the binary case.",

abstract = "Knowledge is a key factor of competitive advantages in the current economic crisis and uncertain environment. There are a number of indicators to measure knowledge advances, however, the benefits for stakeholders and policy makers are limited because of a lack of classification models. This paper introduces an approach to classify 54 countries (in 2007-2009) according to their progress toward a knowledge economy (KE). To achieve this, the aims of this paper are twofold: first, to find clusters of countries at a similar stage of development toward KE to test if they are meaningful; hence, it will be possible to order the clusters from early KEs (last cluster) to advanced KEs (first cluster). Second, having obtained these clusters, it is possible to build various models to detect the advancement of countries toward KE from one year to another due to its classification. Then, three ordinal classifiers from the machine-learning field were compared in order to select the classifier that performs the best and to confirm the ordinal description of the clusters. Finally, an ordinal model based on the Support Vector Ordinal Regression with Implicit Constraints was selected because of its ability to classify the patterns into the clusters, confirming the appropriateness of the clusters and their ordinal nature. The proposed ordinal classifier could be used for monitoring the progress or stage of transition to KE and for analysing whether a country changes clusters, entering one that performs better or worse.",

abstract = "This paper presents a system for weed mapping, using imagery provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Weed control in precision agriculture is based on the design of site-specific control treatments according to weed coverage. A key component is precise and timely weed maps, and one of the crucial steps is weed monitoring, by ground sampling or remote detection. Traditional remote platforms, such as piloted planes and satellites, are not suitable for early weed mapping, given their low spatial and temporal resolutions. Nonetheless, the ultra-high spatial resolution provided by UAVs can be an efficient alternative. The proposed method for weed mapping partitions the image and complements the spectral information with other sources of information. Apart from the well-known vegetation indexes, which are commonly used in precision agriculture, a method for crop row detection is proposed. Given that crops are always organised in rows, this kind of information simplifies the separation between weeds and crops. Finally, the system incorporates classification techniques for the characterisation of pixels as crop, soil and weed. Different machine learning paradigms are compared to identify the best performing strategies, including unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised techniques. The experiments study the effect of the flight altitude and the sensor used. Our results show that an excellent performance is obtained using very few labelled data complemented with unlabelled data (semi-supervised approach), which motivates the use of weed maps to design site-specific weed control strategies just when farmers implement the early post-emergence weed control.

abstract = "In this paper, the performance of different ordinal and nominal multi-class classifiers is evaluated, in a problem of wave energy range prediction using meteorological variables from numerical models. This prediction could be used in problems of wave energy conversion in renewable and sustainable systems for energy supply. Specifically, the work is focused on ordinal classifiers, that have provided excellent  performance in previous applications. The proposed techniques are novel with respect to alternative  classification and regression techniques used up to date, the former not considering the order relation  between classes in a multi-class problem and the latter needing, in general, more complex models.  Another important novelty of the paper is to consider meteorological variables from numerical models as inputs of the classifiers, which has not been done before, to our knowledge, in this context. For this, a  data matching is carried out between meteorological data, obtained from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project in four points around the two buoys subjected to study (a buoy in the Gulf of Alaska and another one in the Southeast of United States), and the wave height or wave period collected by sensors in each buoy. Using this matching, the problem is tackled as an ordinal multi-class classification problem and the objective is to predict the range of height of the wave produced in each buoy and the range of energy flux generated. The classifiers to be compared and the model proposed are fully evaluated in both buoys.  The results obtained are promising, showing an acceptable reconstruction by ordinal methods with  respect to nominal ones in terms of wave height and energy flux. ",

Moreover, a new technique for aligning the kernel matrix taking into account the ordinal problem information is proposed, as well as a regularised gradient ascent methodology which is used to select the optimal dimensionality for the empirical feature space. The capability of the different developed methodologies is evaluated by the use of a nonlinearly separable toy dataset and an extensive set of experiments over 28 ordinal datasets. The results indicate that the tested methodologies are competitive with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms, and they significantly improve the original POM algorithm. ",

However, finding such one-dimensional projection can be too harsh an imposition for some datasets. This paper proposes a multidimensional latent space representation with the purpose of relaxing this projection, where the different classes are arranged based on concentric hyperspheres, each class containing the previous classes in the ordinal scale. The proposal is implemented through a neural network model, each dimension being a linear combination of a common set of basis functions. The model is compared to a nominal neural network, a neural network based on the proportional odds model and to other state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods for a total of 12 datasets. The proposed latent space shows an improvement on the two performance metrics considered, and the model based on the three-dimensional latent space obtains competitive performance when compared to the other methods.",

abstract = "Sustainable development (SD) is a major challenge for nations, even more so in the current economic crisis and uncertain environment. Although different indicators, composite indices and rankings to measure and monitor SD advances at the macro level exist, the benefits for stakeholders and policy makers are still limited because of the absence of predictive models (in the sense of models able to classify countries according to their SD advances). To cope with this need, this paper presents a first approximation via machine learning techniques. First, we study the SD stage of the 27 European Union Member States using information from the years 2005-2010 and different major indicators that have been related to SD. A hierarchical clustering analysis is conducted, and the patterns are categorised as advanced, followers, moderate and initiated, according to their progress towards SD. The classification problem is addressed from an ordinal regression point of view because of the inherent order among the categories. To do so, a reformulation of the one-versus-all scheme for ordinal regression problems is used, making use of threshold models (Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines in this case) and a new trainable decision rule for probability estimation fusion. The empirical results indicate that the constructed model is able to achieve very promising and competitive performance. Thus, it could be used for monitoring the progress towards SD of the different EU countries, in a manner similar to that used for rankings. Finally, the decomposition method based on LR is used for model interpretation purposes, providing valuable information about the most relevant indicators for ranking the end-point variable.",

In this paper, the remitting behavior of immigrants have been addressed by a classification approach that predicts the remittance levels sent by immigrants according to their individual characteristics, thereby identifying the most profitable customers within this group. To do so, five nominal and two ordinal classifiers were applied to an immigrant sample and their resulting performances were compared. The ordinal classifiers achieved the best results; The Support Vector Machine with Ordered Partitions (SVMOP) yielded the best model, providing information needed to draw remitting profiles that are useful for financial institutions. The Support Vector Machine with Explicit Constraints (SVOREX), however, achieved the second best results, and these results are presented graphically to study misclassified patterns in a natural and simple way. Thus, financial institutions can use this ordinal SVM-based approach as a tool to generate valuable information to develop their remittance business strategy.",

Due to this order, alternative performance evaluation metrics are need to be used in order to consider the magnitude of errors. This paper presents an study of the use of a multi-objective optimization approach in the context of ordinal classification. We contribute a study of ordinal classification performance metrics, and propose a new performance metric, the Maximum Mean Absolute Error (MMAE). MMAE considers per-class distribution of patterns and the magnitude of the errors, both issues being crucial for ordinal regression problems. In addition we empirically show that some of the performance metrics are competitive objectives, which justifies the use of multi-objective optimization strategies. In our case, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm optimizes a artificial neural network ordinal model with different pairs of metrics combinations, and we conclude that the pair of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the proposed MMAE is the most favorable. A study of the relationship between the metrics of this proposal is performed, and the graphical representation in the 2 dimensional space where the search of the evolutionary algorithm takes place is analyzed. The results obtained show a good classification performance, opening new lines of research in the evaluation and model selection of ordinal classifiers.",

This paper proposes an ensemble methodology specifically adapted to this type of problems, which is based on computing different classification tasks through the formulation of different order hypotheses. Every single model is trained in order to distinguish between one given class (k) and all the remaining ones, but grouping them in those classes with a rank lower than k, and those with a rank higher than k. Therefore, it can be considered as a reformulation of the well-known one-versus-all scheme. The base algorithm for the ensemble could be any threshold (or even probabilistic) method, such as the ones selected in this paper: kernel discriminant analysis, support vector machines and logistic regression (all reformulated to deal with ordinal regression problems). The method is seen to be competitive when compared with other state-of-the-art methodologies (both ordinal and nominal), by using six measures and a total of fifteen ordinal datasets. Furthermore, an additional set of experiments is used to study the potential scalability and interpretability of the proposed method when using logistic regression as base methodology for the ensemble.

Crop discrimination via remote sensing is a complex task, especially if different crops have a similar spectral response and cropping pattern. In such cases, crop identification could be improved by combining object-based image analysis and advanced machine learning methods. In this investigation, we evaluated the C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network methods, both as single classifiers and combined in a hierarchical classification, for the mapping of nine major summer crops (both woody and herbaceous) from ASTER satellite images captured in two different dates. Each method was built with different combinations of spectral and textural features obtained after the segmentation of the remote images in an object-based framework. As single classifiers, MLP and SVM obtained maximum overall accuracy of 88%, slightly higher than LR (86%) and notably higher than C4.5 (79%). The SVM+SVM classifier (best method) improved these results to 89%. In most cases, the hierarchical classifiers considerably increased the accuracy of the most poorly classified class (minimum sensitivity). The SVM+SVM method offered a significant improvement in classification accuracy for all of the studied crops compared to the conventional decision tree classifier, ranging between 4% for safflower and 29% for corn, which suggests the application of object-based image analysis and advanced machine learning methods in complex crop classification tasks.",

abstract = "In this paper, two neural network threshold ensemble models are proposed for ordinal regression problems. For the first ensemble method, the thresholds are fixed a priori and are not modified during training. The second one considers the thresholds of each member of the ensemble as free parameters, allowing their modification during the training process. This is achieved through a reformulation of these tunable thresholds, which avoids the constraints they must fulfil for the ordinal regression problem. During training, diversity existed in the different projections generated by each member is taken into account for the parameter updating. This diversity is promoted in an explicit way by using a 'diversity-encouraging' error function, extending the well-known Negative Correlation Learning framework to the area of ordinal regression, and inheriting many of its good properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve competitive generalization performance when considering four ordinal regression metrics.",

abstract = "Ordinal classification refers to classification problems in which the classes have a natural order imposed on them because of the nature of the concept studied. Some ordinal classification approaches perform a projection from the input space to 1-dimensional (latent) space that is partitioned into a sequence of intervals (one for each class). Class identity of a novel input pattern is then decided based on the interval its projection falls into. This projection is trained only indirectly as part of the overall model fitting. As with any latent model fitting, direct construction hints one may have about the desired form of the latent model can prove very useful for obtaining high quality models. The key idea of this paper is to construct such a projection model directly, using insights about the class distribution obtained from pairwise distance calculations. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated with eight nominal and ordinal classifiers methods, ten real world ordinal classification datasets, and four different performance measures. The new methodology obtained the best results in average ranking when considering three of the performance metrics, although significant differences are found only for some of the methods. Also, after observing other methods internal behaviour in the latent space, we conclude that the internal projection do not fully reflect the intra-class behaviour of the patterns. Our method is intrinsically simple, intuitive and easily understandable, yet, highly competitive with state-of-the-art approaches to ordinal classification.",

abstract = "The mixed use of different shapes of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) in Radial Basis
Functions Neural Networks (RBFNNs)

version of the standard RBFNN, based on the Generalised Gaussian Distribution
(GGD). The Generalised Radial Basis Function (GRBF) proposed in this paper is able
to reproduce other different Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) by changing a real
parameter $\tau$. In the proposed methodology, a Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm
(HEA) is employed to estimate the number of hidden neuron, the centers, type and
width of each RBF associated with each radial unit. In order to test the performance of
the proposed methodology, an experimental study is presented with twenty datasets
from the UCI repository. The GRBF Neural Network (GRBFNN) was compared to
RBFNNs with Gaussian, Cauchy and Inverse Multiquadratic RBFs in the hidden layer
and to other classifiers, including different RBFNN design methods, Support Vector
Machines (SVMs), a sparse probabilistic classifier (Sparse Multinominal Logistic
Regression, SMLR) and other non-sparse (but regularised) probabilistic classifiers
(Regularised Multinominal Logistic Regression, RMLR). The GRBFNN models were
found to be better than the alternative RBFNNs for
almost all datasets, producing the highest mean accuracy rank.

abstract = "Wind speed reconstruction is a challenging problem in areas (mainly wind farms) where there are not direct wind measures available. Different approaches have been applied to this reconstruction, such as measure-correlate-predict algorithms, approaches based on physical models such as reanalysis methods, or more recently, indirect measures such as pressure, and its relation to wind speed. This paper adopts the latter method, and deals with wind speed estimation in wind farms from pressure measures, but including different novelties in the problem treatment. Existing synoptic pressure-based indirect approaches for wind speed estimation are based on considering the wind speed as a continuous target variable, estimating then the corresponding wind series of continuous values. However, the exact wind speed is not always needed by wind farms managers, and a general idea of the level of speed is, in the majority of cases, enough to set functional operations for the farm (such as wind turbines stop, for example). Moreover, the accuracy of the models obtained is usually improved for the classification task, given that the problem is simplified. Thus, this paper tackles the problem of wind speed prediction from synoptic pressure patterns by considering wind speed as a discrete variable and, consequently, wind speed prediction as a classification problem, with four wind level categories: low, moderate, high or very high. Moreover, taking into account that these four different classes are associated to four values in an ordinal scale, the problem can be considered as an ordinal regression problem. The performance of several ordinal and nominal classifiers and the improvement achieved by considering the ordering information are evaluated. The results obtained in this paper present the Support Vector Machine as the best tested classifier for this task. In addition, the use of the intrinsic ordering information of the problem is shown to significantly improve ranks with respect to nominal classification, although differences in accuracy are small.",

This practice is an extensive one in the automotive industry. Automotive manufacturers invest a lot of effort and money to improve the vibro-acoustics performance of their products because they have to comply with the noise emission standards. International standards, commonly known as pass-by and coast-by noise test, define a procedure for measuring vehicle noise at different receptor positions. The aim of this work is to develop a novel model which can be used in pass-by noise test in vehicles based on ensembles of hybrid Evolutionary Product Unit or Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (EPUNN or ERBFNNs) at high frequencies. Statistical models and ensembles of hybrid EPUNN and ERBFNN approaches have been used to develop different noise identification models. The results obtained using different ensembles of hybrid EPUNNs and ERBFNNs show that the functional model and the hybrid algorithms proposed provide a very accurate identification compared to other statistical methodologies used to solve this regression problem.",

Computational tools for the decision-making process in liver transplantation can be useful, despite the inherent complexity involved. Therefore, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and various techniques to select individuals from the Pareto front are used in this paper to obtain artificial neural network models to aid decision making. Moreover, a combination of two pre-processing methods has been applied to the dataset to offset the existing imbalance. One of them is a resampling method and the other is a outlier deletion method. The best model obtained with these procedures (with AUC = 0.66) give medical experts a probability of graft survival at three months after the operation. This probability can help medical experts to achieve the best possible decision without forgetting the principles of fairness, efficiency and equity.

abstract = "This paper presents a structural distance based crossover for neural network classifiers, which is applied as part of a Memetic Algorithm (MA) for evolving simultaneously the structure and weights of neural network models applied to multiclass problems. Previous researchers have shown that this simultaneous evolution is a way to avoid the noisy fitness evaluation. The MA incorporates a crossover operator that shows to be useful for ameliorating the permutation problem of the network representation (i.e. different genotypes can be used to represent the same neural network phenotype), increasing the structural diversity of the individuals and improving the accuracy of the results. Instead of a recombination probability, the crossover operator considers a similarity parameter (the minimum structural distance), which allows to maintain a trade-off between global and local search. The neural network models selected in this work are the Product-Unit Neural Networks (PUNNs), due to their increasing relevance in those classification problems which show a high order relationship between the input variables. The proposed MA is intended to reduce the possible overtraining problems which can raise in some datasets for this kind of models. The evolutionary system is applied to eight classification benchmarks and the results of an Analysis of Variance contrast (ANOVA) show the effectiveness of the structural based crossover operator and the capacity of our algorithm to obtain evolved PUNNs with a higher classification accuracy than those obtained using other evolutionary techniques. On the other hand, the results obtained are compare with popular effective machine learning classification methods, resulting in a competitive performance.
