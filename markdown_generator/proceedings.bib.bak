abstract = "In this paper, an approach based on a time series clustering technique is presented by extracting relevant features from the original temporal data. A curve characterization is applied to the daily contagion rates of the 34 sanitary districts of Andalusia, Spain. By determining the maximum incidence instant and two inflection points for each wave, an outbreak curve can be described by six intensity features, defining its initial and final phases. These features are used to derive different groups using state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The experimentation carried out indicates that {\$}{\$}k=3{\$}{\$}k=3is the optimum number of descriptive groups of intensities. According to the resulting clusters for each wave, the pandemic behavior in Andalusia can be visualised over time, showing the most affected districts in the pandemic period considered. Additionally, in order to perform a pandemic overview of the whole period, the approach is also applied to joint information of all the considered periods",

Only recently, ordinal classification (where class labels present a natural ordering) has been tackled through the framework of CNNs, such as adapting the classic Proportional Odds Model to deep architectures. Also, ordinal classification datasets commonly present a high imbalance in the number of samples of each class, making it an even harder problem. In this work, we present a new CNN architecture based on the Ordinal Binary Decomposition (OBD) technique using Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) and show how it can improve performance over previously proposed methods.",

abstract = "Time Series Ordinal Classification (TSOC) is yet an unexplored field of machine learning consisting in the classification of time series whose labels follow a natural order relationship between them. In this context, a well-known approach for time series nominal classification was previously used: the Shapelet Transform (ST). The exploitation of the ordinal information was included in two steps of the ST algorithm: 1) by using the Pearson's determination coefficient (R²) for computing the quality of the shapelets, which favours shapelets with better ordering, and 2) by applying an ordinal classifier instead of a nominal one to the transformed dataset. For this, the distance between labels was represented by the absolute value of the difference between the corresponding ranks, i.e. by the L1 norm. In this paper, we study the behaviour of different Lp norms for representing class distances in ordinal regression, evaluating 9 different Lp norms with 7 ordinal time series datasets from the UEA-UCR time series classification repository and 10 different ordinal classifiers. The results achieved demonstrate that the Pearson's determination coefficient using the L1.9 norm in the computation of the difference between the shapelet and the time series labels achieves a significantly better performance when compared to the rest of the approaches, in terms of both Correct Classification Rate (CCR) and Average Mean Absolute Error (AMAE).

abstract = "Activation functions are used in neural networks as a tool to introduce non-linear transformations into the model and, thus, enhance its representation capabilities. They also determine the output range of the hidden layers and the final output.  Traditionally, artificial neural networks mainly used the sigmoid activation function as the depth of the network was limited. Nevertheless, this function tends to saturate the gradients when the number of hidden layers increases. For that reason, in the last years, most of the works published related to deep learning and convolutional networks use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), given that it provides good convergence properties and speeds up the training process thanks to the simplicity of its derivative. However, this function has some known drawbacks that gave rise to new proposals of alternatives activation functions based on ReLU. In this work, we describe, analyse and compare different recently proposed alternatives to test whether these functions improve the performance of deep learning models regarding the standard ReLU.",

abstract = "Classification and regression techniques are two of the main tasks considered by the Machine Learning area. They mainly depend on the target variable to predict. In this context, ordinal classification represents an intermediate task, which is focused on the prediction of nominal variables where the categories follow a specific intrinsic order given by the problem. Nevertheless, the integration of different algorithms able to solve ordinal classification problems is often unavailable in most of existing Machine Learning software, which hinders the use of new approaches. Therefore, this paper focuses on the incorporation of an ordinal classification algorithm (NSLVOrd) in one of the most complete ordinal regression frameworks, "Ordinal Regression and Classification Algorithms framework (ORCA)" by using both fuzzy rules and the JFML library. The use of NSLVOrd in the ORCA tool as well as a case study with a real database are shown where the obtained results are promising.",

abstract = "The adjustment of the hyperparameters and network structure of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) composes an important step towards building effective, but still efficient learning models. The selection of the best configuration is a problem-dependent task that involves to explore an enormous and complex search space. Due to this reason, the use of heuristicbased search fits perfectly within this task, seeking to obtain a near to optimal solution in a complex and large exploratory space. This paper presents SCRODeep, a self-adapting algorithm based on a statistically-driven Coral Reef Optimisation algorithm (SCRO), for the selection of the most adequate CNNs architecture in a particular domain. This metaheuristic has been designed to navigate through a search space where the architecture (defining the particular set of layers, including convolutional or pooling layers), and the hyperparameters of the network (i.e. activation functions, number of units or the kernel initializer, among others) are represented, but where the connections weights and bias are inferred using typical CNNs optimisation algorithms. In contrast to other approaches, where the use of a metaheuristic implies in turn to fix a series of hyperparameters (i.e. the mutation probability in a genetic algorithm), our approach follows a selfparametrisation perspective, thus removing the necessity of fixing these values. The method has been tested in the design of CNNs for image classification, showing that SCRODeep is able to find competitive solutions, while the complexity of the architectures found is constrained.",

abstract = "This work applies evolutionary product unit neural networks (EPUNNs) to estimate global inclined irradiation at real time and predict it 10 minutes in advance. Both tasks are accomplished simultaneously, by using one single model with two outputs. One advantage of our approach is that the predictions of inclined irradiation are obtained without the need of a series of historical data. In this way, the model only considers one measured input variable, which is the horizontal global irradiation at the previous instant. Besides, the evolutionary algorithm used to optimize the network allows us to obtain the best adapted topology of the model with respect to the number of hidden neurons and synaptic connections. Very promising results are obtained, where the inclined irradiation I B (t) is estimated with an accuracy of 5.10% of nRMSE, while it is predicted 10 minutes in advance with an accuracy of 16.97%.",

In order to further improve the results, we combine this link function with a loss cost that takes the distance between classes into account, based on the weighted Kappa index.

This procedure is needed to determine potential changes in a long-term future operational environment of marine and coastal structures. The methodology transforms the time series into a sequence of labeled segments, using a genetic algorithm (GA) in combination with a likelihood-based local search. Then, Artificial Neural Networks models (ANN) are trained with a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA), with the objective of predicting the occurrence or not of SSWH events. The MOEA is designed to optimize the global accuracy and individual sensitivities for both classes, due to the imbalanced nature of the problem (SSWH are rarer than non SSWH). The methodology is applied to a time series collected from a buoy of the Gulf of Alaska, showing that the GA is able to group SSWH events in a specific cluster and that the MOEA obtains accurate ANN models when predicting these events.",

abstract = "Time series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance measure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different subsequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time series objects of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of time series clustering based on two clustering stages. In a first step, a least squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all the segments are projected into same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another specific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time series objects are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmentation. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against two state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising.",

abstract = "Wave height prediction is an important task for ocean and marine resource management. Traditionally, regression techniques are used for this prediction, but estimating continuous changes in the corresponding time series can be very difficult. With the purpose of simplifying the prediction, wave height can be discretised in consecutive intervals, resulting in a set of ordinal categories. Despite this discretisation could be performed using the criterion of an expert, the prediction could be biased to the opinion of the expert, and the obtained categories could be unrepresentative of the data recorded. In this paper, we propose a novel automated method to categorise the wave height based on selecting the most appropriate distribution from a set of well-suited candidates. Moreover, given that the categories resulting from the discretisation show a clear natural order, we propose to use different ordinal classifiers instead of nominal ones. The methodology is tested in real wave height data collected from two buoys located in the Gulf of Alaska and South Kodiak. We also incorporate reanalysis data in order to increase the accuracy of the predictors. The results confirm that this kind of discretisation is suitable for the time series considered and that the ordinal classifiers achieve outstanding results in comparison with nominal techniques.",

Existen una serie de problemas que complican la integraci{\'o}n del recurso e{\'o}lico en la red el{\'e}ctrica. Uno de ellos es conocido como rampas de viento, que son incrementos o decrementos de gran magnitud en la velocidad del viento en un tiempo reducido. Estas rampas de viento pueden da{\~n}ar las turbinas en los parques e{\'o}licos, as{\'i} como reducir los ingresos generados a partir de la producci{\'o}n del parque. Actualmente, la mejor forma de afrontar este problema es predecir estas rampas de viento, de forma que se puedan parar las turbinas con suficiente antelaci{\'o}n, evitando as{\'i} los da{\~n}os que puedan producirse. Para realizar esta predicci{\'o}n, se suelen utilizar modelos que puedan aprovechar la informaci{\'o}n temporal. Uno de los modelos m{\'a}s conocidos con estas caracter{\'i}sticas son las redes neuronales recurrentes. En este trabajo utilizaremos las conocidas como Echo State Networks (ESNs), las cuales han demostrado obtener un buen rendimiento en predicci{\'o}n de series temporales. En concreto, proponemos utilizar ESNs de complejidad reducida para afrontar un problema de predicci{\'o}n de rampas de viento en tres parques e{\'o}licos en Espa{\~n}a. A nivel metodol{\'o}gico, se comparan tres arquitecturas diferentes de red, dependiendo de la configuraci{\'o}n de las conexiones de la capa de entrada con el reservoir o directamente con la capa de salida. Los resultados muestran que, por lo general, los mejores resultados son obtenidos por la estructura Delay Line Reservoir with Feedback (DLRB) y que el aumento en el rendimiento obtenido por la arquitectura de Doble reservoir con respecto a la arquitectura de Simple reservoir es m{\'i}nima, y teniendo en cuenta el gran aumento de complejidad computacional de la arquitectura Doble, concluimos que los mejores resultados son obtenidos por la combinaci{\'o}n de la estructura DLRB con la arquitectura Simple.",

Este tipo de eventos pueden llegar a suponer costes materiales e incluso humanos muy importantes. Uno de los sectores m{\'a}s influenciados por las condiciones de muy baja visibilidad son los medios de transporte, fundamen- talmente el transporte a{\'e}reo, cuya actividad se ve seriamente mermada, provocando retrasos, cancelaciones y, en el peor de los casos, terribles accidentes. En el aeropuerto de Valladolid son muy frecuentes las situaciones de baja visibilidad por niebla, especialmente en los meses considerados de invierno (noviembre, diciembre, enero y febrero). Esto afecta de forma directa a la manera en la que operan los vuelos de este aeropuerto. De esta forma, es muy importante conocer las posibles condiciones de niebla a corto plazo para aplicar procedimientos de seguridad y organizaci{\'o}n dentro del aeropuerto. En el presente art{\'i}culo se propone el uso de diferentes modelos de ventanas din{\'a}micas y est{\'a}ticas junto con clasificadores de aprendizaje autom{\'a}tico, para la predicci{\'o}n de niveles de niebla. En lugar de abordar el problema como una tarea de regresi{\'o}n, la variable de inter{\'e}s para la caracterizaci{\'o}n del nivel de visibilidad en el aeropuerto (Rango Visual de Pista, RVR) se discretiza en 3 categor{\'i}as, lo que aporta mayor robustez a los modelos de clasificaci{\'o}n obtenidos.

During the evolution, the solutions are locally optimised and reintroduced in the optimization process. The hybridization is performed using two well-known state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Bottom-Up and Top-Down. The resulting algorithm, called memetic CRO (MCRO), is compared against standard CRO, its statistically driven version (SCRO) and their hybrid versions (HCRO and HSCRO, respectively).

abstract = "Renewable energy is the fastest growing source of energy in the last years. In Europe, wind energy is currently the energy source with the highest growing rate and the second largest production capacity, after gas energy. There are some problems that difficult the integration of wind energy into the electric network. These include wind power ramp events, which are sudden differences (increases or decreases) of wind speed in short periods of times. These wind ramps can damage the turbines in the wind farm, increasing the maintenance costs. Currently, the best way to deal with this problem is to predict wind ramps beforehand, in such way that the turbines can be stopped before their occurrence, avoiding any possible damages. In order to perform this prediction, models that take advantage of the temporal information are often used. One of the most well-known models in this sense are recurrent neural networks. In this work, we consider a type of recurrent neural networks which is known as Echo State Networks (ESNs) and has demonstrated good performance when predicting time series. Specifically, we propose to use the Minimum Complexity ESNs in order to approach a wind ramp prediction problem at three wind farms located in the Spanish geography. We compare three different network architectures, depending on how we arrange the connections of the input layer, the reservoir and the output layer. From the results, a single reservoir for wind speed with delay line reservoir and feedback connections is shown to provide the best performance.",

Moreover, a new variant of the BBePSO algorithm is proposed, which takes into account the ositions of the particles throughout the generations, where those close in time are given more importance. This methodology is referred to as weighted BBePSO (WBBePSO). The solutions obtained by all the algorithms are finally hybridised with a local search algorithm, combining simple segmentation strategies (Top-Down and Bottom-Up). WBBePSO is tested in 13 time series and compared against the rest of algorithms, showing that it leads to the best results and obtains consistent representations.",

abstract = "Weather and atmospheric patterns are often persistent. The simplest weather forecasting method is the so-called persistence model, which assumes that the future state of a system will be similar (or equal) to the present state. Machine learning (ML) models are widely used in different weather forecasting applications, however, these models need to be compared to the persistence model to analyse whether ML provides a competitive solution to the problem at hand. In this paper we devise a new model for predicting low-visibility in airports using the concepts of mixture of experts. Visibility level is coded as two different ordered categorical variables (cloud height and runway visual height). The underlying system in this application is stagnant approximately in 90% of the cases and standard ML models fail to improve on the performance of the persistence model. Because of this, instead of trying to simply beat the persistence model using ML we use this persistence as a baseline and learn a ordinal neural network model that refines its results by focusing on learning weather fluctuations. The results show that the proposal outperforms persistence and other ordinal autoregressive models, especially for longer time horizon predictions and for the runway visual height variable.",

abstract = "The term ordinal regression refers to classification tasks in which the categories have a natural ordering. The main premise of this learning paradigm is that the ordering can be exploited to generate more accurate predictors. The goal of this work is to design class switching ensembles that take into account such ordering so that they are more accurate in ordinal regression problems. In standard (nominal) class switching ensembles, diversity among the members of the ensemble is induced by injecting noise in the class labels of the training instances. Assuming that the classes are interchangeable, the the labels are modified at random. In ordinal class switching, the ordering between classes is taken into account by reducing the transition probabilities to classes that are further apart. In this manner smaller label perturbations in the ordinal scale are favoured. Two different specifications of these transition probabilities are considered; namely, an arithmetic and a geometric decrease with the absolute difference of the class ranks. These types of ordinal class switching ensembles are compared with an ensemble method that does not consider class-switching, a nominal class-switching ensemble, an ordinal variant of boosting, and two state-of-the-art ordinal classifiers based on support vector machines and Gaussian processes, respectively. These methods are evaluated and compared in a total of $15$ datasets, using three different performance metrics. From the results of this evaluation one concludes that ordinal class-switching ensembles are more accurate than standard class-switching ones and than the ordinal ensemble method considered. Furthermore, their performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods considered in the analysis. Thus, class switching ensembles with specifically designed transition probabilities, which take into account the relationships between classes, are shown to provide very accurate predictions in ordinal regression problems.",

abstract = "Real-world classification datasets often present a skewed distribution of patterns, where one or more classes are under-represented with respect to the rest. One of the most successful approaches for alleviating this problem is the generation of synthetic minority samples by convex combination of available ones. Within this framework, adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) sampling is a relatively new method which imposes weights on minority examples according to their learning complexity, in such a way that difficult examples are more prone to be over-sampled. This paper proposes an improvement of the ADASYN method, where the learning complexity of these patterns is also used to decide which sample of the neighbourhood is selected. Moreover, to avoid suboptimal results when performing the random convex combination, this paper explores the application of an iterative greedy algorithm which refines the synthetic patterns by repeatedly replacing a part of them. For the experiments, six binary datasets and four over-sampling methods are considered. The results show that the new version of ADASYN leads to more robust results and that the application of the iterative greedy metaheuristic significantly improves the quality of the generated patterns, presenting a positive effect on the final classification model.",

The basic idea in this case is that similarity between segments can be used to characterise those segments with high significant wave heights, and then being able to predict them. A recently metaheuristic, the Coral Reef Optimization (CRO) algorithm is proposed for this task, and we analyze its performance by comparing it with that of a GA in three wave height time series collected in three real buoys (two of them in the Gulf of Alaska and another one in Puerto Rico). The results show that the CRO performance is better than the GA in this problem of time series segmentation, due to the better exploration of the search space obtained with the CRO.",

abstract = "Wind power ramp events (WPREs) are strong increases or decreases of wind speed in a short period of time. Predicting WPREs is of vital importance given that they can damage the turbines in a wind farm. In contrast to previous binary approaches (ramp versus non-ramp), a three-class prediction is proposed in this paper by considering: negative ramp, non-ramp and positive ramp, where the natural order of the events is clear. The independent variables used for prediction include past ramp function values and meteorological data obtained from physical models (reanalysis data). The proposed methodology is based on reservoir computing and an over-sampling process for alleviating the high degree of unbalance of the dataset (non-ramp events are much more frequent than ramps). The reservoir computing model is a modified echo state network composed by: a recurrent neural network layer, a nonlinear kernel mapping and an ordinal logistic regression, in such a way that the order of the classes can be exploited. The standard synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is applied to the reservoir activations, given that the direct application over the input variables would damage its temporal structure. The performance of this proposal is compared to the original dataset (without over-sampling) and to nominal logistic regression, and the results obtained with the oversampled dataset and ordinal logistic regression are found to be more robust.",

In the present work, we propose a system combining image analysis and machine learning for detecting melanoma presence and severity. The severity is assessed in terms of melanoma thickness, which is measured by the Breslow index. We extract 100 features considering the shape, colour, pigment network and texture of the benign and malignant lesions, tackling this problem as a five-class classification problem, where the first class represents benign lesions and the remaining four classes represent different stages of the melanoma (as measured by the Breslow index). From a machine learning point of view, this problem is a partially ordered classification task. Because of this, we propose specific machine learning models to exploit the partial order information. In this sense, we experimentally demonstrate that specifically designed models achieve better performance than a set of nominal and ordinal classifiers, considering both the imbalanced nature of the problem and the magnitude of the ordinal error in the prediction.",

artificial neural network classifier with hybrid basis functions is
trained with a multiobjetive evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) in order to

abstract = "This paper presents a complete system for weed mapping, using imagery provided by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and machine learning methods. Weed control in precision agriculture designs site-specific control treatments based on weed coverage, where the key is to provide precise weed maps timely. Traditional remote platforms, such as piloted planes and satellites, are, however, not suitable for early weed mapping, given their low spatial and temporal resolutions, as opposed to the ultra-high spatial resolution provided by UAVs. The system here proposed makes use of UAV-imagery and is based on the following steps: 1) Divide the image, 2) compute and binarise the vegetation indexes, 3) detect crop rows, 4) optimise the parameters and 4) learn a classification model. Given that crops are organised in rows, the use of crop rows simplifies the separation between weeds and crops, which is a common handicap given the spectral similitude of both. Different machine learning paradigms are compared in this paper to identify the best suited strategy, including unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised techniques. Our experiments also study the effect of the flight altitude, the sensor used and the use of previously trained models at a different height. Our results show that 1) very promising performance can be obtained using very few labelled data (although complemented with unlabelled data via the semi-supervised approach) and 2) that the classification model can be learnt in a subplot of the experimental field at low altitude and then applied to the whole field at a higher height, which simplifies the whole process. These results motivate the use of this strategy to design site-specific weed control strategies for early post-emergence weed control.",

This is a problem of high interest, because WPREs increases the maintenance costs of wind farms and hinders the energy production. The standard echo state network architecture is modified by replacing the linear regression used to compute the reservoir outputs by a nonlinear support vector machine, and past ramp function values are combined with reanalysis data to perform the prediction. Another novelty of the study is that we will predict three type of events (negative ramps, non-ramps and positive ramps), instead of binary classification of ramps, given that the type of ramp can be crucial for the correct maintenance of the farm. The model proposed obtains satisfying results, being able to correctly predict around 70% of WPREs and outperforming other models.",

abstract = "Ordinal input variables are common in many supervised and unsupervised machine learning problems. We focus on ordinal classification problems, where the target variable is also categorical and ordinal. In order to represent these variables for measuring distances or applying continuous mapping functions, they have to be transformed to numeric values. This paper evaluates five different methods to do so. Two of them are commonly applied by practitioners, the first one based on binarising the ordinal input variable using standard indicator variables (NomBin), and the second one based on directly mapping each category to a consecutive natural number (Num). Furthermore, three novel proposals are evaluated in this paper: 1) an ordinal binarisation based on the order of the input variable (OrdBin), 2) the analysis of pairwise distances between input patterns to recover the latent variable generating the ordinal one (NumLVR), and 3) the refinement of the standard numeric transformation by recovering the distance between sets of patterns of consecutive categories (NumCDR). A thorough empirical evaluation is done, considering 12 datasets, 5 performance metrics and 4 classifiers (2 of them of nominal nature and 2 of ordinal nature). The results show that the NomBin representation method leads to the worst results, and that both Num and NumCDR methods obtain very good performance, although NumCDR results are consistently better for almost all performance metrics and classifiers considered.",

Early detection is crucial for ensuring five-year survival (which varies between 15% and 99% depending on the melanoma stage). Melanoma severity is typically diagnosed by invasive methods (e.g. a biopsy). In this paper, we propose an alternative system combining image analysis and machine learning for detecting melanoma presence and severity. The 86 features selected consider the shape, colour, pigment network and texture of the melanoma. As opposed to previous studies that have focused on distinguishing melanoma and non-melanoma images, our work considers a finer-grain classification problem using five categories: benign lesions and 4 different stages of melanoma. The dataset presents two main characteristics that are approached by specific machine learning methods: 1) the classes representing melanoma severity follow a natural order, and 2) the dataset is imbalanced, where benign lesions clearly outnumber melanoma ones. Different nominal and ordinal classifiers are considered, one of them being based on an ordinal cascade decomposition method. The cascade method is shown to obtain good performance for all classes, while respecting and exploiting the order information. Moreover, we explore the alternative of applying a class balancing technique, presenting good synergy with the ordinal and nominal methods.",

abstract = "This paper tackles marine energy prediction from the classification point of view, by previously discretising the real objective variable into a set of consecutive categories or ranges. Given that the range of energy flux is enough to obtain an approximation of the amount of energy produced, the purpose of this discretisation is to simplify the prediction task. A special kind of autoregressive models are considered, where the category to be predicted depends on both the previous values of energy flux and a set of meteorological variables estimated by numerical models. Apart from this, this paper introduces two different ways of adjusting the order of the autoregressive models, one based on nested cross-validation and the other one based on a dynamic window. The results show that these kind of models are able to predict the time series in an acceptable way, and that the dynamic window procedure leads to the best accuracy without needing the additional computational cost of adjusting the order of the model.",

The usefulness of these approaches is tested by considering support vector machines, one of the most popular machine learning classifiers.

This is an interesting data mining field, but its application to the optimal segmentation of financial time series is a very challenging task, so accurate algorithms are needed. In this sense, GAs are relatively poor at finding the precise optimum solution in the region where the algorithm converges. Thus, this work presents a hybrid GA algorithm including a local search method, aimed to improve the quality of the final solution. The local search algorithm is based on maximizing a likelihood ratio, assuming normality for the series and the subseries in which the original one is segmented.

Specific classification algorithms are able to preserve this manifold  structure. On the other hand, ordinal regression covers those learning problems where the objective is to classify patterns into labels from a set of ordered categories. There have been very few works combining both ordinal regression and manifold learning. Additionally, privileged information refers to some specialfeatures which are available during classifier training, but not in the test phase. This paper contributes a new algorithm for combining ordinal regression and manifold learning, based on the idea of constructing aneighbourhood graph and obtaining the shortest path between all pairs of patterns. Moreover, we proposeto exploit privileged information during graph construction, in order to obtain a better representation of theunderlying manifold. The approach is tested with one synthetic experiment and 5 real ordinal datasets, showinga promising potential.",

Instead of learning independent models for all the subtasks, the optimum convex combination of the kernel matrices is then obtained, leading to a single model able to better discriminate the classes in the feature space.

Due to the limitations of classical statistical methods, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm to automatically segment the series together with a method to perform time series segmentation comparisons. Without a priori information, the method clusters together most of the TPs and avoids false positives, which is a promising result given the challenging nature of the problem.",

In this learning setting, thresholds models are one of the most used and successful techniques. These models are based on the idea of projecting the patterns to a line, which is thereafter divided into intervals using a set of biases or thresholds. This paper proposes a general likelihood-based optimisation framework to better fit probability distributions for ordered categories. To do so, a specific probability distribution (log-gamma) is used, which generalises three commonly used link functions (log-log, probit and complementary log-log). The experiments show that the methodology is not only useful to provide a probabilistic output of the classifier but also to improve the performance of threshold models when reformulating the prediction rule to take these probabilities into account.",

In contrast to real-world data, synthetic datasets provide a controlled environment for analysing concrete critic points such as outliers tolerance, data dimensionality influence and class imbalance, among others. In this paper, a framework for synthetic data generation is developed with special attention to patterns ordered in the space, data dimensionality, class overlapping and data multimodality. Variables such as position, width and overlapping of data distributions in the n-dimensional space are controlled by considering them as n-spheres. The method is tested in the context of ordinal regression, a paradigm of classification where there is an order arrangement between categories. The contribution of the paper is the full control over data topology and over a set of relevant statistical properties of the data.

abstract = "Remittance flows have drawn the attention of international development community interested in enhancing their potential benefits in the recipient communities. This papers deals with the migrants remitting patterns, addressing this economic behavior by a classification approach rather than the traditional regression one. Five nominal and two ordinal classifiers were compared in order to verify the nature of the problem and to obtain a model which predicts the remittance levels sent by migrants according to their individual characteristics. The best performance was achieved by the support vector machine with ordered partitions, an ordinal classifier based on binary decomposition, and thus three remitting profiles for immigrants were drawn from the support vectors obtained. As result, the proposed model can be used as a tool for better factoring remittances flows into the design of policies and programs in the migrants home country.",

abstract = "Many real life problems require the classification of items into naturally ordered classes. These problems are traditionally handled by conventional methods intended for the classification of nominal classes, where the order relation is ignored. This paper proposes a hybrid neural network model applied to ordinal classification using a possible combination of projection functions (product unit, PU) and kernel functions (radial basis function, RBF) in the hidden layer of a feed-forward neural network. A combination of an evolutionary and a gradient-descent algorithms is adapted to this model and applied to obtain an optimal architecture, weights and node typology of the model. This combined basis function model is compared to the corresponding pure models: PU neural network, and the RBF neural network. Combined functions using projection and kernel functions are found to be better than pure basis functions for the task of ordinal classification in several datasets.

The results obtained present the maximum MAE (maximum of the mean absolute error of the difference between the true and the predicted ranks of the worst classified class) as a very interesting alternative for ordinal regression, being the less uncorrelated with respect to the rest of measures. Additionally, SVOREX and SVORIM are found to yield very good performance when the objective is to minimize this maximum MAE.

When compared to other state-of-the-art classifiers like AdaBoost, EBC(SVM) or KDLOR,
the proposed algorithm is shown to be competitive. The models obtained could allow medical experts to predict survival rates without knowing exactly the number of days the transplanted organ survived.

practical exercises and the implicit and mandatory distributed tasks between stu-
dent teams. In addition, different professionals from public and private institutions
have supervised the activity. The results of two polls (taken before and after this
experience) show that student SA skills were considerably improved thanks to the
laboratory. Moreover, the laboratory was an excellent tool to promote teamwork and
collaboration among students and very suitable for transnational education, the lab
being remotely accessed from different locations.

To guide the MOEA, two non-cooperative metrics have been used for ordinal classification: the Average of the Mean Absolute Error, and the Maximum Mean Absolute Error of all the classes.
