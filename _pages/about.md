I am Full Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of Córdoba (Spain). 

My current research interests include: machine learning, ordinal classification, evolutionary neural networks, application of these techniques to real problems (renewable energies, precision agriculture, biomedicine...). I am a member of the [AYRNA](http://www.uco.es/grupos/ayrna/index.php/en) research group.

I was born in Córdoba, Spain. I received the B.S. degree in computer science from the University of Sevilla and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from the University of Granada.
